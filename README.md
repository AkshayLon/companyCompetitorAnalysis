# Project Description
<p>
  Imagine that you are an investor and you are researching any general company. A part of the process involves looking into rival firms and how the competition might play out in the market.
  Identifying which firms are directly in competition with the one you are analysing is not as simple as picking companies in the same industry or sector. There is also a need to look deeper into the business model and analyse factors such as the nature of the customer base etc.
  Well this program does just that.
</p>
<p>
  This program uses NLP techniques as well as other machine learning models to analyse various business models at a deeper level and display which companies are most likely to be in direct competition with a given firm that you are analysing, making the investment research process more efficient and accurate.
